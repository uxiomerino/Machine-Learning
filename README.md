# Machine-Learning
These are the projects I developed related to Machine Learning in University of A Coru√±a

The projects completed during the 2nd year are written in Julia, and those from the 3rd are in Python (Jupyter Notebooks)

The work will be updated during my years at College with the assignments related to this subject


# Detailed work:
1. Practicas20.jl: Iin this file, we completed a general exploration of the tools used in Machine Learning with the famous iris Dataset (first aproach to ML)
2. P2.jl: A more complex work, where we developed a code that can detect if there is an eye in a picture
3. Practica1.ipynb: This project consisted in an extense study of hyperparameter selection (MADELON Dataset)
4. Practica_2_Generacion_imagenes.ipynb: In this project, we started to get familiar with autoencoders.
5. Practica3.ipynb: The objective of this code is to predict secuencies, such as the compared value of the euro against the dollar.
6. P2_semester2.ipynb: First contact with Reinforcement Learning, with the Pendulumn-v0 enviroment
7. P3_semester2.ipynb: Semi-supervised learning and auto-learning
